##Meeting 1: 10/20/16, Fall 2016

###2 Main Goals of Data Squad: 

####1. Documentation/record keeping; building institutional memory
* Create a functional organization to combat personnel turnover by building resource guides/instructions (so new RAs can easily adapt) 

####2. Get people to make contributions to live code as soon as possible

---
RAs will first develop R skills and then use that developing expertise to make contributions. Contributions in the form such as data cleaning (taking raw file from raw output and reorganizing it in a format) or even figuring out how to make figures blue (someone with more advanced training can benefit from these “simple” expertise b/c it will save time). RAs will document these skills to make them sustainable for future members.  

---
###The End Point: 
Archiving/curating data to make accessible to other researchers (open science framework; making things public) 

---

###Meetings:
* A regular part will be people presenting what they are working on  
* Discuss conventions for how to share and how to talk to each other (such as consistent coding styles)  
* Learn how to write excellent notes within the code, since it is important to properly annotate what the code is doing. (# or $ at beginning of line: text line (non-functional))

---
###Resources: 
* R: computational engine/programming language   
* Rstudio: graphical interface/integrated development environment; visually handy way to build scripts for R    
* Rmarkdown: package/add-on that makes it easier to produce documents in various formats (such as word doc, html, etc.) 

---
###Questions:  
* How to communicate with each other (i.e. with private information) because free Github repositories are public. Textwrangler + Email(?)
