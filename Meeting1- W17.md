Lab Notes

  A.	Tidy Data- Wickham
    a.	4 Types of Data Manipulation
      i.	Filtering: subset of data based on certain criteria
      ii.	Transform: adding or modifying variables. These modifications can involve either a single variable or multiple variables
      iii.	Aggregate: collapsing multiple values into a single value
      iv.	Sort: changing the order of observation
      
  B.	Pre-registration Packet
    a.	Purpose: inform people of what you plan to do, describes experiment that will be done (describes the methods)
    
  C.	DataSquad Objectives:
    a.	GitHub: platform for collaborative coding
      i.	Initiate a Pool Request whenever we want to “merge” our process to the main code line.
    b.	Kai’s Independent Progress:
      i.	Assignment1-CleanTrust: looking for ways to detect errors on the raw data file
      ii.	On the lines that start with “#” they are places where we can annotate our notes, R does not read these lines
      iii.	Look Over “#Summary” where Kai summarizes his progress
    c.	Division Of Labor:
      i.	Emily suggested we practice “4 Types of Manipulation” onto Raw4 File, similar to what Kai has done.
      ii.	Lab Work Assignment:
          1.	Lexi: GitHub Functionality Facilitator
          2.	Emily: Liaison between 2 Data Groups
          3.	Nathalie: Take notes, post onto GitHub
          4.	Kai: DataSquad Leader
