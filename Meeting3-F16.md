##Meeting 3: 11/03/16, Fall 2016

Use the **Issues** tab to post any questions/concerns you may have. This way, the repository can be modified regularly to resolve any confusions (about the sub-tasks, etc.) before next week's meeting. 

Use the pull request feature to share your code, suggested modification, and any notes/annotations

There is now a new repository, titled **Standard Conventions**, to establish standardized coding conventions for Fesslab. 

The advanced RAs with experience in coding may work on the  **disgust-style** repository. Others will continue with Assignment 1. 

----

####Things to know about Assignment 1: 
* This assignment involves several data source files that are linked by a common ID
* The subtask "locating and using ID variables..." involves identifying and resolving discrepancies caused by manual error (for example, 1grape1230 may be wrongly entered as 1grpe1230). 
* The modifications should be in the script; never change/alter the raw files
* Next week, Adam may provide us with the variable names and their corresponding full items 
* A key could be a 2 column matrix, with one side having the full variable name/response and the other side having the shortened version
* The goal is to produce a script that cleans the raw, untouched data files into a perfectly usable set for data analyses.
